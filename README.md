# pig-game-js

A classic dice rolling game called pig game, but with few changes. (Game Ref: [Link text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game))

Instead the original game, i implemented a d20 dice logic. If the user rolls 1 with d20 dice, all of his/her score will be lost. In d6 dice, we have 17% chance to get a 1, but with d20 dice we have 5% chance to get the number 1.

Code is written in vanilla js and is written in DRY and clean code principles. HTML and CSS design belongs to my preferences. In CSS, there are 4 types of responsive screens for different devices.
